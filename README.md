# Breast Cancer Classification  
Breast cancer is a common cancer in women, and one of the major causes of death among women around the world. 
Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most widespread type of breast cancer with about 80% of all diagnosed cases. 
IDC is cancer that began growing in a milk duct and has invaded the fibrous or fatty tissue of the breast outside of the duct. 
Early accurate diagnosis plays an important role in choosing the right treatment plan and improving survival rate among the patients. 
In recent years, efforts have been made to predict and detect all types of cancers by employing artificial intelligence. 
An appropriate dataset is the first essential step to achieve such a goal. 
This repo introduces a histopathological microscopy image dataset of 922 images related to 124 patients with IDC. 
The dataset has been published and is accessible through the web at: http://databiox.com. 
The distinctive feature of this dataset as compared to similar ones is that it contains an 
equal number of specimens from each of three grades of IDC, which leads to approximately 50 specimens for each grade.

During the same period, annual cancer mortality rose almost 16%, from 28,500 to 32,987 cancer-related deaths. 
The number of new cancer cases is expected to rise by more than 120% over the next 2 decades.
